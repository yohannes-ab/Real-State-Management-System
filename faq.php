There are many circumstances that can effect the length of the “life of the offer.” </br> Your Realtor should know how long of a “life” to give to your Request.  If you’re looking to purchase a home that is newly listed and the possibility of multiple offers exists, a shorter life is recommended. </br> If the home you’re looking to purchase has been on the market for 3 months and the seller is located out of town, a 2 day “life” maybe necessary and/or recommended.</p>

Before you begin looking at homes, make a list of your priorities:  location, size, lot, amenities, etc.  Establish a set of minimum requirements and a "wish list".  Minimum requirements are things that a house must have for you to consider it, while a "wish list" covers things that you'd like to have but aren't essential.</p>

                                    <p>A buyer prefers a home that is in move-in condition and will pay top price for it.  It is important to be sure your home is in superior condition before listing it.  Make repairs prior to selling.  This will help reduce the risk of buyers trying to renegotiate the price due to repairs or problems that may arise from a private inspection done prior to closing.
                                    Having your property in top condition will attract more buyers to your home giving you an excellent chance to sell your home faster.

                                        Work on your home's curb appeal. Make sure your landscape is pristine. Mow the grass, clean up any debris and weed the garden beds, sweep the sidewalk.</br>
                                        Clean the windows and make sure the paint is not chipped or flaking.  Windows should be free of ripped or bent screens. These should be replaced or removed entirely. Windows should also be clean and cobweb free. Being able to have draperies open, allowing light into the house is a plus at any showing.</br>
                                        Clean and freshen up rooms, furnishings, floors, walls and ceilings. Make sure that bathrooms and kitchens are spotless.</br>
                                        Providing a feeling of openness in a home can be accomplished quite easily and allows the house to appear larger. Open areas free of clutter are very important in showing a home.</br>
                                        Make sure the basic appliances and fixtures work. Replace leaky faucets and frayed cords.</br>
                                        Eliminate the source of any bad smells, such as the kitty box. Use air freshener or bake a batch of cookies before your open house to ensure that the house smells inviting.</br>
                                        Invest in a couple of vases of fresh flowers to place around the house and next to any information about the house you have prepared for buyers.</br>

Selling a home can be a lot of work, but with all your efforts, they can pay off quickly and with a larger sum of money.</p>

                                    <p> In addition to comparing the home to your minimum requirement & wish lists, consider the following:

                                Is there enough room for both the present & the future?</br>
                                Are there enough bedrooms and bathrooms?</br>
                                Is the house structurally sound?</br>
                                Do the mechanical systems and appliances work?</br>
                                Is the yard big enough?</br>
                                Do you like the floor plan?</br>
                                Will your furniture fit in the space?</br>
                                Is there enough storage space?</br>
                                Does anything need to be repaired or replaced?</br>
                                Imagine the home in good and bad weather and in each season.  Will you be happy with it year round?</br>

Take your time and think carefully about each house you see.  Ask your real estate owner to point out the pros and cons of each home from a professional standpoint.</p>
